<div class="content">

	  <img src = "images/companiesLogos/forbes.svg" style = "float: left; height: 100; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;"/><p align="justify">Even the simplest job applications can take over 3 minutes to complete. Even if you're using LinkedIn's "Easy Apply" button, the average applicant will submit 500+ applications and will end up spending in excess of over 250+ hours of wasted time just clicking a couple of buttons! 
		According to Forbes, even so-called "casual" job searches could soak up to 7 or 8 hours per week<sup><a target="_blank" href = "https://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2016/02/12/this-is-how-much-time-you-should-really-be-spending-on-your-job-search/?sh=3e653b82772c"> 2</a></sup>. More involved by searches could take 40-60 hours per week! The internet has made it increasinly easy to find job, but ever so much more difficult to spend hundres of hours in front of a computer actually searching for the perfect job. That's where The Easy Apply Bot come in!</p align="justify">
<br><br>
	<img src = "images/companiesLogos/Payscale.svg.png" style = "float: right; height: 100; margin: auto auto auto 15px ;"/><p align="justify">Payscale listed "Online Application Forms" as the number one worst thing about searching for a job<a target="_blank" href = "https://www.payscale.com/career-news/2015/12/the-8-worst-things-about-the-job-search"><sup>1</sup></a>. Sites such as LinkedIn and Glassdoor are awesome because they allow you to view thousands, even tens-of thousands of job posting. However, that means you have to wade through as many postings to find the one that matches your skills, despite so called "advanced Artificial Intelegence to find those jobs- and then you have to go through the extra step of applying to a position at a company which may very well never respond to your application. All that wasted time means that you may need to apply to hundreds of position that lead nowhere. </p align="justify">
<br>
	  <img src = "images/companiesLogos/US_News_logo.svg" style = "float: left; height: 100; margin: auto 15px;"/><p align="justify">     U.S. News even goes as far to say: "While online application forms have made things more convenient for employers, job-seekers report regularly running into systems that won't upload their resumes, ask yes/no questions that don't fit many candidates' situations, and require information that few have on hand (like a high school GPA or the exact date you started a job 15 years ago). And when candidates know there's a good chance they won't even get so much as an acknowledgment, having to spend an hour wrestling with an onerous application system simply to submit a resume is an especially bitter pill to swallow."'</p align="justify">

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What languages does the Easy Apply Bot Support?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p align="justify">Currently, the Easy Apply Bot only supports English, therefore your language setting must be set to "English" on the respective websites. Failing to do so may cause unexpected errors to occur. If demand is high enough, we may develope other languages as well</p align="justify">
</div>
	
<button type="button" class="collapsible">I think the Easy Apply Bot is frozen or broken, what should I do?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p align="justify"> We had make the Easy Apply Bot get around those pesky <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHAs</a>. One of the way we do that is by purposely taking a break, and limiting the total number of position you can apply to at once. We do this because it would be extememly easy to detect if suddenly one (or in our case, thousands or people) starts applying to thousands of jobs a second.
	  <br>  <br>
	  Before, you report that the Easy Bot is broken, please check to ensure that the Easy Bot isn't just taking a break, or that you've reached the maximum applications for the day. You should see a message if this is true.
	 <br>   <br>
	 Please also enusre that the Easy Bot hasn't timed out (you will get a message telling you so), and that your computer is connected to the internet.
	  <br>  <br>
	  If you're still having issues, you may be using an out dated verion of the Easy Apply Bot. We are currently working on implementing a version control system that will automatically update the Easy Apply Bot to the newest version. In the meantime, please reach out to our customer service team, and we'll get send you a link to the latest version free of charge.
	  <br>  <br>
	  Lastly, please try closing (or force closing) the Easy Apply Bot first and try restarting it before sending an error report.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">I'm getting hundred of emails from LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc. What should I do?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p align="justify">
We encourage that you turn off "email me whenever I apply to a position" notification from these websites when using the Easy Apply Bot, otherwise you may get an email for each and every job that you apply to...and these can add up very quickly. You will still recieve emails sent directly from employeers, though.</p align="justify">

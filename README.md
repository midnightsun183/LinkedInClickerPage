- [ ] Code obfuscation – to ensure that no one can reverse engineer the application.
      To obfuscate your application, multiple tools can be used. 
      You can either use packages such as pyarmor that are made to obfuscate Python code or open source tools such as pyinstaller in combination with cpython (for most       sensitive code).

- [ ] License verification – to ensure that customers need a license key before they can use the application 
      (eg. so that you can restrict which features they can use and how long the license is valid).

- [ ] Webshop – so that customers can obtain a license key to unlock functionality. When you have obfuscation and license verification in place, we need a way for customers to be able to order a license key. If you already have Stripe, you can use the recurring billing module, which acts like an interface for plans defined in your Stripe account.
